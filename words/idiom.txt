scot-free
a dime a dozen
not the sharpest tool in the shed
know the ropes
quality time
right off the bat
go for broke
a fool and his money are soon parted
eat my hat
under your nose
a cut above
shot in the dark
close but no cigar
every cloud has a silver lining
in a pickle
a guinea pig
cry over spilt milk
between a rock and a hard place
read 'em and weep
fish out of water
cut to the chase
don't count your chickens before they hatch
it's not brain surgery
keep your eyes peeled
talk the talk
lovey dovey
a hairâ€™s breadth
happy as a clam
keep on truckin'
curiosity killed the cat
drawing a blank
burst your bubble
roll with the punches
wouldn't harm a fly
head over heels
there's no i in team
down for the count
i smell a rat
a little bird told me
let her rip
back to the drawing board
up in arms
what goes up must come down
put a sock in it
a cut below
under the weather
poke fun at
quick on the draw
a cold day in hell
throw in the towel

cut the mustard
a busy bee
dropping like flies
a cold day in july
top drawer
right out of the gate
a bite at the cherry
a few sandwiches short of a picnic
jaws of life
a lemon
a hundred and ten percent
barking up the wrong tree
when the rubber hits the road
no ifs, ands, or buts
mouth-watering
tug of war
yada yada
an arm and a leg
son of a gun
don't look a gift horse in the mouth
birds of a feather flock together
jumping the gun
easy as pie
in the red
a chip on your shoulder
ring any bells?
on the same page
fight fire with fire
back to square one
give a man a fish
money doesn't grow on trees
a cold fish
wild goose chase
cry wolf
if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
